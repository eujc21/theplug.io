#theplug.io
**theplug.io** is a marketplace to gather the best content writers who are truly passionate about their topics. This platform will allows writers to focus on their writing, instead of how to distribute their content for compensation. Our goal with the design of the plug, is to put focus on the content itself. This will allow those bloggers to truly look at the content amongst its analytics, which will be publicly displayed.


### Goals

- Get authors to write content which is rich in information and style.
- Bring readers to the **theplug.io** in order to gage the value of the article.
- Display publicly the analytics of the single article.
- Offer licensing for the rights to post the article on a blogger outside of **theplug.io**, and do a profit share with the author.
- Sell exclusive rights and traffic from a particular article to those bloggers or companies who wish to purchase and do a profit share with the article.
- Protect the authors content, by making it extremely difficult to steal content off the webpage.
